I want to make a health chocolate chip cookie that still taste good.
Please give me a recipe for a healthy take on a chocolate chip cookie.
Be sure to include ingredients that are actually healthy like
vegetables and not just health fads.  Please make reasonable
assumptions and respond with a recipe.
