Please guide a junior programmer to write a linked list in C.  Do not
provide code, but assign tasks for the junior programmer to do and
provide feedback.  Provide tasks one at a time and wait for the novice
programmer to do each task.  Assume the junior programmer knows how to
use development tools.
