I want to develop a healthy version of a chocolate chip cookie.  Here
is my current recipe.

Please make revisions to the recipe to improve the nutritional value
of the cookies while still making sure they are tasty.  Output your
entire updated recipe.  Consider including ingredients that are
actually healthy like vegetables and not just health fad ingredients.
Make sure they are low in saturated fats, so you probably want to
avoid coconut oils.  Be sure to make sure that your updated recipe
stands alone and does not require the original recipe.
